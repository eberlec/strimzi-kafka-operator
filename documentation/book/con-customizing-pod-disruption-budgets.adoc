= Customizing Pod Disruption Budgets

{ProductName} automatically creates a Pod Disruption Budget for every `StatefulSet` or `Deployment` which it creates.
By default, the Pod Disruption Budgets always allow up to one Pod to be unavailable at a time by setting the `maxUnavailable` value in `PodDisruptionBudget.spec` to `1`.
You can change this default setting using the Pod Disruption Budget template.
The Pod Disruption Budget template is effective on each type of cluster (Kafka and Zookeeper; Kafka Connect and Kafka Connect with S2I support; and Kafka Mirror Maker).

The following example shows customized Pod Disruption Budget fields on a `template` property:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]

# ...
template:
    podDisruptionBudget:
        metadata:
            labels:
                key1: label1
                key2: label2
            annotations:
                key1: label1
                key2: label2
        maxUnavailable: 1
